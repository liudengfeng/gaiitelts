                ],
                "answer": "C. is running",
                "explanation": "句子中使用了动词“see”，表示看到正在发生的事情，因此动词“run”也应该是正在进行时态的“is running”。"

                ],
                "answer": "C. laughed",
                "explanation": "根据句子中的动词“talked”，可以确定句子发生在过去。因此，动词“laugh”也应该是过去时态的“laughed”。"

                ],
                "answer": "A. laugh",
                "explanation": "句子中的“cannot but”表示“不得不”，因此动词“laugh”也应该是强制性的语气。而“laughing”表示正在进行的行为，不符合句子意思；“to laugh”表示将来的行为，不符合句子意思；“laughed”表示过去的行为，也不能表示强制性的语气。因此，选项 A 是唯一正确的答案。"

                "answer": "D. too old to",
                "explanation": "句子中的“too old”表示“太老了”，因此动词“to do”也应该表示不能做的意思。而“enough old to”表示“足够老了可以做的”，不符合句子意思；“to old too”是错误的搭配；“very old to”表示“非常老了可以做的”，也不符合句子意思。因此，选项 D 是唯一正确的答案。"
