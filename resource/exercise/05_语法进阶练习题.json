            {
                "question": " If you came earlier, you ______ have seen him.",
                "cn": "如果你来的早些,你也许会见到他。",
                "options": [
                    "A. can",
                    "B. may",
                    "C. might",
                    "D. will"
                ],
                "answer": "C. might",
                "explanation": "might 表示可能性，在句子中表示“也许会”。根据句子意思，如果来的早些，就有可能见到他。因此，选项 C 是唯一正确的答案。"
            },
            {
                "question": " We don't have ______ of it.",
                "cn": "我们对此瞭解不多。",
                "options": [
                    "A. many knowledge",
                    "B. much knowledges",
                    "C. much knowledge",
                    "D. many knowledges"
                ],
                "answer": "C. much knowledge",
                "explanation": "句子中的“knowledge”表示“知识”。根据句子意思，我们对此瞭解不多，也就是说我们对此的知识不多。因此，选项 C 是唯一正确的答案。在英语中，表示“很多”的形容词可以是“much”或“many”，但“much”通常用于不可数名词，而“many”通常用于可数名词。在本句中，“knowledge”是不可数名词，因此应该使用“much”。"
            },
            {
                "question": " He is ______ that everybody likes him.",
                "cn": "他是如此好的一个人,每个人都喜欢他。",

                    "D. such man good"
                ],
                "answer": "B. such a good man",
                "explanation": "在英语中，形容词修饰名词时，如果形容词前面有限定词，则要用“a”或“an”。在本句中，“good”前面有限定词“such”，因此要用“a”。"
            },
            {
                "question": " ______ to believe such nonsense!",
                "cn": "他这傻瓜,相信这种荒唐的话!",

                    "C. What idiot is he",
                    "D. What an idiot he is"
                ],
                "answer": "D. What an idiot he is",
                "explanation": "在英语中，感叹句通常以“what”开头，后面跟上形容词或副词，然后跟上主语和谓语。在本句中，“idiot”是形容词，因此要用“what an idiot”来表达感叹。\n\n此外，在英语中，句末的感叹号是句子的结尾标点，表示句子表达的感情。因此，选项 D 是唯一正确的答案。"

                "question": " The staff of our company ______ there by train.",

                ],
                "answer": "C. are going",
                "explanation": "在英语中，表示未来的一般时态，要用“be going to”结构。在本句中，“are going”是“be going to”的第三人称复数形式，表示“我们公司的职员”即将乘火车到那里。因此，选项 C 是唯一正确的答案。"

                    "D. though"
                ],
                "answer": "A",
                "explanation": "在英语中，“whether”表示“不管是……还是……”。在本句中，表示不管明天下雨还是晴天，我们都要去那里。因此，选项 A 是唯一正确的答案。"
            },
            {
                "question": " If he were a teacher, he ______ in school.",

                    "D. was"
                ],
                "answer": "A",
                "explanation": "If he were a teacher, he would be in school. This is because the conditional sentence is in the past tense, so the verb would be used to describe the hypothetical situation."

                    "D. Turned"
                ],
                "answer": "C",
                "explanation": "The verb 'turn' is in the present participle form, which is used to describe an action that is in progress. The other options are all in the past tense, which is not appropriate in this context."
            },
            {

                ],
                "answer": "B",
                "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The earlier we start, the earlier we'll get there. The word 'earlier' is an adjective. It is used to modify the noun 'we'. The word 'the' is a definite article. It is used to modify the adjective 'earlier'. The word 'earlier' is in the comparative form. It is used to compare two things. The word 'the earliest' is in the superlative form. It is used to compare three or more things."

                "answer": "D",
                "explanation": "It is possible to finish the work in two days. It is a singular subject. So the pronoun should be singular. It is the only singular pronoun in the options."
